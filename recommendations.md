# Recommendations Progress

- [x] Persist Sleeper player data in the application database and reuse it when serving player data.
- [x] Add an automated player sync process with a manual sync endpoint for forcing updates.
- [x] Expose player sync controls in the draft board so users can refresh player data on demand.
